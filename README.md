# **Meeting Room Reservation System**




## Popis
The Meeting Room Reservation System allows managing and reserving meeting rooms in offices. It also supports setting up priority rooms, which means that some rooms can be reserved when others are already booked at a specific time, or when an employee with a higher priority can reserve it over others. This priority can be set within the system. The system will also display attributes of each room, such as maximum capacity and available equipment. It is primarily designed for corporations with a large number of employees to facilitate office organization.
## Functionality
